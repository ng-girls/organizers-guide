# Mentors Preparation
based on Robert's experience

## 🔥 Important

* Respect the Code of Conduct  
  * means: ngGirls is **no dating platform**, avoid sexist jokes or comments, every culture and religion is welcome → respect each other

## 🎯 Goals

* Most important goal of the workshop is **empowerment**
  * Make your attendees happy, welcomed, and feel good about being a developer
  * Share your experiences and learnings from your career path
  * Offer help
  * Support also in simple ways (e.g., bringing a coffee)

## 🧱 Basics

* You learn **together**
  * You will get unexpected questions, have the challenge to describe things in an easy way, and learn about yourself
  * Show your attendees that you learn too

* You don't always have to be there
  * At some point the attendees can also help each other

* Show them the basic skills of a modern developer
  * help, google, ask, struggle, debug & learn together
  * find a solution together
  * make sure they don’t just copy & paste or only use AI

* Not all attendees reach the final part  
  * IT'S OK — they should learn, network, and have fun while developing  
  * Provide help to finish the tutorial at home

* If they solved the tutorial:
  * let them go further with simple other tasks
  * offer the [extra little workshop](https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/more-workshops/crud_http)
  * try to solve things with different approaches (reactive forms, signal forms, control flows)

* If in a discussion they demand custom knowledge:
  * try to support them
  * let them solve a task also in a different way with a different part of Angular
  * feel free to go deeper also into basic stuff like CSS/HTML if needed

## 💡 Advises

* Try to describe from the view of an unknown participant
  * use easy pictures or analogies (e.g., every part of the body is a component)

* Nodding and smiling doesn’t mean they understood it
  * sometimes cultural issues prevent asking questions
  * ask questions to check understanding

## 📡 Work in Groups (for online workshops)

* In online workshops it is recommended to keep interacting
* Maybe give your attendees small customizing tasks for the tutorial
* Feel free to use your own video conferencing tool when you work in groups  
  * e.g. https://meet.jit.si/

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

* This tutorial is not perfect
  * not everything is an instruction — sometimes it’s just for trying out
  * take care that they see the CLI commands page (often overlooked)

* Pull requests are welcome  
  * but it’s also good if not everything is perfect (helps struggling)

* Sometimes a restart of the CLI helps if nothing works

* On GitHub you find the [original solution](https://github.com/ng-girls/todo-list) of the tutorial  
  * at the end of each chapter is the solution of the current chapter as a StackBlitz

* If it's not possible to install the CLI on the laptop, just use stackblitz.com  
  * Don’t waste too much time on installations — just ask the organizers
