# Mentors Preparation

based on Robert's experience

## Important

* Respect the Code of Conduct
  * means: ngGirls is no dating platform, avoid sexists jokes or comments, every culture and religion is welcome =&gt; respect each other

## Goals

* Most important goal of the workshop is empowerment
  * Make your attendees happy, welcomed and feel good of being a developer
  * Share your experiences and learnings from your career path
  * Offer help 

## Basics

* You learn together
  * You will get unexpected questions, have the challenge to describe stuff in a easy way, learn about yourself
  * Show your attendees that you learn too
* You don't always have to be there
  * At some point the attendees can also help each other
* Show them the basic skills of a modern developer
  * help, google, ask, struggle, debug & learn together
  * find a solution together
* Not all attendees reach the final part
  * IT'S OK, because they should learn, network and have fun while developing
  * Provide help to finish the tutorial at home
* If they solved the tutorial let them go further with simple other tasks

## Advises

* Try to describe from the view of an unknown participant
  * use easy to understand pictures \(e.g. every part of the body is a component\)
* Nodding and smiling doesn't mean that they have understood it
  * sometime cultural issues prevent from asking
  * ask questions to check the understanding
  
## Work in Groups
* In online workshop it is recommended to keep interacting
* maybe give your attendees little customizing tasks for the tutorial
* feel free to use your own video conferencing tool, when you work in groups:
  * e.g. https://meet.jit.si/

## Troubleshooting

* This tutorial is not perfect
  * not everything is an instruction, sometimes its just for trying out
  * take care that they see the CLI commands page \(will be sometimes overseen\)
* pull requests are welcome
  * but its also good if not everything is perfect \(helps struggling\)
* Sometimes a restart of the CLI helps if nothing works
* On github you find the solution of the tutorial
* If its not possible to install the CLI on the laptop, just use stackblitz.com
  * Don't waste too much time for installations, maybe just ask us organizers
